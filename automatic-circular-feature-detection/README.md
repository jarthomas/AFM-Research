## Steps

### 1. Load Images

Load the TIFF image (`tri_circ.tiff`) for intensity calculation and the PNG image (`tri.png`) for clearer representation.

### 2. Convert to Grayscale

Convert both images to grayscale if they are in RGB format.

### 3. Calibration

Calibrate the pixel size based on a known physical size of 3.00 Âµm across 512 pixels. The calibration factor is calculated as:

```latex
\text{Intensity (nA)} = \text{Pixel Intensity} \times 0.0140
