# Gwyddion Python Modules

This repository contains Gwyddion Python modules, from basic to advanced, specifically designed for the manipulation and analysis of AFM data. Note complications may arise if both Gwydion 32 and 64-bit versions are installed simultaneously on your system. If you intend on setting-up a version of Gwydion for Python scripting, I would recommend configuring the dependenices below in a virtual environment to prevent negative impacts to your 65-bit version.

To get started, you'll need to download and install the following:

- **[Gwyddion (32-bit version)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gwyddion/files/pygtk-win32/)**
- **[Python 2.7](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gwyddion/files/pygtk-win32/)**

Additionally, make sure to install these three essential Python packages:

- **[pygtk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gwyddion/files/pygtk-win32/)**
- **[pycairo](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gwyddion/files/pygtk-win32/)**
- **[pygobject](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gwyddion/files/pygtk-win32/)**
